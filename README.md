# Water Management System
An Automatic Water Management System for domestic use is designed to efficiently monitor and control water usage in a household. 
It typically involves sensors to detect water levels in tanks and automated motor control to fill the water. 
The system can be integrated with IoT devices, allowing users to control and monitor their water usage remotely via a smartphone app or a web interface. 
Key features may include automated scheduling of water supply, leak detection, and usage analytics to promote water conservation, dry run protection and optimize water distribution throughout the home.
